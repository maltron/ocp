# Use Ansible Vault to Encrypt this file
# Step #1: Define a password that it will used to encrypt this file (e.g. my_secret)
#          $ echo 'my_secret' > .vault_pass
# Step #2: Remove this file, so you can create a encrypted version
#          $ rm credentials.yaml
# Step #3: Finally, create a encrypted version using Ansible Vault
#          $ ansible-vault create credentials.yaml 
#          ...with the following content (Please add your credentials)
username:

# (OPTIONAL) If you add your docker credentials, it will log into a Docker registry
#            directly
